# AI-Character-Editor-HTML-Based
A browser-based tool for creating, editing, and exporting AI character cards. It supports multiple file formats, provides detailed editing fields, and includes a built-in guide for creating high-quality AI personalities.

Inspired by https://avakson.github.io/character-editor
Which was originally made by Zoltan#8287 and forked by AVAKSon#0498

I wanted to create my own edited/custom version of it.

#### Features

* Customizable design with real-time color and theme controls
* Support for multiple formats, including TavernAI v2, YAML, and Text Generation JSON
* Import from and export to PNG files with embedded metadata
* Smart editing interface with live token and character counts
* Dynamic panels for color customization and writing tips
* Field editor for all major character attributes (name, summary, personality, scenario, examples, tags, greetings, etc.)
* Metadata management, including creator info, versioning, and depth prompts
* Multi-greeting support with independent editing for each message
* Real-time character statistics (token usage, fields filled, total characters)
* Image upload and live preview for character portraits
* Built-in “Character Creation Guide” sidebar explaining best practices and format structures
* Configurable export options to save as PNG, JSON, YAML, or TextGen formats
